I Have my own uses for this but I just wanted to share it as a template to start a new bot with. Selenium Is new to me, so I wanted to start simple. I wanna scale this a little more to see what can be done with it. So I may update this in the future.

This bot Takes input such as a website like == facebook.com == it does not need the https:\\ as it is already included, just to save a headache.

If you use chrome you may need to download some of there drivers == 

     -- Chrome Driver == https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
     
     -- Otherwise FireFox works without installing anything extra
