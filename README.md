I Have my own uses for this but I just wanted to share it as a template to start a new bot with. Selenium Is new to me, so I wanted to start simple. I wanna scale this a little more to see what can be done with it. So I may update this in the future.

This bot Takes input such as a website like == facebook.com == it does not need the https:\\ as it is already included, just to save a headache.

If you use chrome you may need to download some of there drivers == 

     -- Chrome Driver == https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
     
     -- Otherwise FireFox works without installing anything extra

Peek The Makeing of this template here == 

     -- Youtube == https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG44SNxRgZU

Update 1 == 

     -- I added a small list of sites for you to use. Input should look like 
          -- instagram.com, twitch.tv, etc you get the point
     
     -- I added enough code to get you to the login and enter the specified email and password for you, If you want to click the login button to login just copy the XPATH from using inspect element
     
     -- I have decided that python is simple enough to make more adjustments and I'm having some fun doing so I'm gonna keep update this one too. I also got some more work to do with my yt bot I haven't done much to it, or not enough to post at least sorry :<
